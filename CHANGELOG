1.1.0	2013-11-18
FEATURE Updated probe and output module interface that allows arbitrary
	data to be passed from the probe module (e.g. additional TCP fields)
	that can then be output as requested.

FEATURE	Replaced simple_file, and redis_file output modules with csv module
	that allows user controlled output of what fields shoudl be output
	to a csv file. As well, implemented --list-output-fields that allows
	users to find what fields are available.	

FEATURE	Added output-filters that allow users to control what types of packets
	that want output (e.g. classification = "SYNACK" && is_repeat = 0)

FEATURE	Drop root privileges after opening necessary sockets if run as
	privileged user.

FEATURE	Added paged bitmap for removing duplicate responses so that if small
	subnets are scanned, large amount of memory is no longer required.

FEATURE	Fast scanning of small subnets. Scanning small subnets no longer
	requires iterating over the entire IPv4 address space, which allows
	ZMap-like speed for all network sizes.

FEATURE Scan CIDR blocks from the command-line instead of only through
	whitelist file (e.g. zmap -p 443 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8)

FEATURE Redis output module now allows connecting to arbitrary redis servers
	and lists from the command-line via output module parameter

FEATURE JSON output module added

FEATURE 32-bit support

FEATURE UDP Packet Support

BUGFIX	Source port in UDP module corrected to use network order instead of
	host order

1.1.1	2013-12-16
BUGFIX	Fixed bit-map, which was incorrectly deduplicating responses

BUGFIX	CMake correctly installs files into /etc/zmap

1.1.2	2014-01-21
BUGFIX	Off-by-one error in paged bitmap
